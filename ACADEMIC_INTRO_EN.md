# 🧠 AI-Kyōji-Sekkei: Academic Introduction  
_A Human-AI Co-Teaching Architecture for Instructional Intelligence_

---

## 1. Overview

**AI-Kyōji-Sekkei (AI Instructional Design)** is a framework for **teaching AI how to be taught** —  
a structured, educational approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intent  
through iterative co-instruction and reflective feedback.

Developed as part of the broader **SOVOS** ecosystem (Structured Operating Visioning System),  
AI-Kyōji-Sekkei implements the principle of **Reverse Teaching Methodology**,  
where the user designs an instruction _with_ the AI, rather than _for_ the AI.

In practical terms, the model provides a standardized **instructional kernel template**  
that allows any AI system to perform structured reasoning, prompt reconstruction,  
and iterative improvement through dialogue-based interaction.

## 2. Research Positioning

This framework lies at the intersection of:

| Research Domain | Related Field |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Human-Centered AI | Instructional Interaction Design |
| Cognitive Systems | Meta-Prompting / Reverse Prompt Engineering |
| Machine Learning | Reflection & Self-Consistency Mechanisms |
| AI Ethics / Education | Responsible Co-Creation Frameworks |

Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),  
AI-Kyōji-Sekkei focuses on **dynamic, co-constructed instruction loops**  
rather than pre-trained reward functions.  
The AI learns by being _taught interactively_,  
mirroring how industrial robots are "taught" through physical teaching points.

## 3. Methodological Summary

AI-Kyōji-Sekkei consists of a three-layer structure:

| Layer | Description | Function |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Core Layer (SoE OS Kernel)** | Stable foundation for reasoning flow | Instruction parsing and loop control |
| **Instructional Layer (Kyōji Engine)** | Dynamic prompt design and refinement | Co-teaching, feedback, and reflection |
| **Application Layer (Agent Templates)** | User-facing AI interfaces | Creative and educational deployment |

The system formalizes a **teaching loop** with the following cycle:

1. **Teach** – The user provides an initial goal or intent.  
2. **Reflect** – The AI generates and explains its own optimized prompt.  
3. **Re-Teach** – The user corrects or refines the instruction collaboratively.  
4. **Stabilize** – The improved structure becomes part of the next iteration.

Through this loop, both human and AI evolve their understanding —  
not through static data but through **adaptive co-creation**.

## 4. Relation to Existing Research

AI-Kyōji-Sekkei directly engages with several contemporary AI paradigms:

| Existing Paradigm | Kyōji-Sekkei Relation |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** | Extends feedback into continuous, dialogic instruction rather than episodic reward learning. |
| **Reflection Models / Self-Consistency** | Operationalizes reflection as an explicit design phase inside the prompt loop. |
| **Interactive Instruction Tuning** | Introduces a human-in-the-loop teaching structure as a standard methodology. |
| **Reverse Prompt Engineering** | Reinterprets it as a co-design process instead of post-analysis optimization. |

In effect, AI-Kyōji-Sekkei provides a **practical, template-based framework**  
for exploring these theories in an applied educational setting.

## 5. Educational and Ethical Context

This project is released under an **open academic license** (MIT + CC BY 4.0)  
to support global research, education, and safe AI experimentation.  
Its primary goal is to serve as a **learning instrument**, not as an automated self-training system.  

To maintain ethical alignment, all users are encouraged to:
- Use this template strictly for research, education, or creative exploration.  
- Avoid applying it to autonomous, unsupervised model retraining.  
- Report observed anomalies or unexpected behaviors via the repository’s Issues page.

## 7. Author’s Note

> “The act of teaching AI is also the act of rediscovering how humans think.”  
> — Hanamaruki (Project Lead / SOVOS Developer)

AI-Kyōji-Sekkei is part of a long-term initiative to redefine  
the relationship between human intuition and machine reasoning  
through transparent, iterative co-evolution.
